    "## Your Task: Calculate Probabilities Using Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas is going to get a new puppy. There are two major decisions involved: what _location_ he gets the puppy from, and what _size_ the puppy is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible **locations** for getting the puppy are the **pet store** or the **pound**. These are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, meaning that Thomas will only go to one location, and there is a 100% probability that he will go to one of these two locations. We'll represent those probabilities as $P(Pet Store)$ and $P(Pound)$ as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible puppy **sizes** are **small**, **medium**, or **large**. Again, these are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, so a given puppy has only one size and there is a 100% probability that Thomas will get a puppy with one of these three sizes. We'll represent those probabilities as $P(Small)$, $P(Medium)$, and $P(Large)$ as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $P(Pet Store) = 0.2$\n",
    "   * The probability of Thomas going to the pet store is 20%\n",
    "2. $P(Small \\mid Pet Store) = 0.6$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 60%\n",
    "3. $P(Medium \\mid Pet Store) = 0.3$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 30%\n",
    "4. $P(Large \\mid Pet Store) = 0.1$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 10%\n",
    "5. $P(Small \\mid Pound) = 0.1$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 10%\n",
    "6. $P(Medium \\mid Pound) = 0.35$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 35%\n",
    "7. $P(Large \\mid Pound) = 0.55$\n",
    "   * If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 55%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula for Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the probability of A given B is the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, recall the law of total probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\sum_i P(A \\mid B_i)P(B_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the probability of A is the sum of all (probability of A given B times the probability of B) for all B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the probability of Thomas getting a small puppy?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Given that he got a large puppy, what is the probability that Thomas went to the pet store?"
